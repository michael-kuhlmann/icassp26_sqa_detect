This page shows a random selection of audio samples that were used in the listening test for our ICASSP submission, **"SPEECH QUALITY-BASED LOCALIZATION OF LOW-QUALITY SPEECH AND TEXT-TO-SPEECH SYNTHESIS ARTEFACTS"**.

We evaluated **three** systems:

- LibriTTS: Human speech from LibriTTS `test-clean`
- StyleTTS2
- F5-TTS

For each system, we created a **Control** set with random samples of about five words and a **Detection** set using frame-level quality scores to detect segments of low quality.

Each section displays 20 cards with an audio player and a corresponding transcription (text to be synthesized).

We especially encourage you to compare the **StyleTTS2** control and detection sets.
